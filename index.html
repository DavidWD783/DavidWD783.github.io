    <p class = "second-para">The spring classics in cycling begin in February with Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and last until April, ending with "La Doyenne", "the old lady", or Liege-Bastogne-Liege.  The races are extremely long and often cover both the flat farmland and rolling "bergs" of France, Holland, and primarily Belgium.  The racers that typically win the spring classics are considered some of the strongest bike racers in the world (see: <a href = "http://www.petersagan.com/">Peter Sagan</a>, <a href = "http://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/john-degenkolb/">John Degenkolb</a>, <a href = "http://www.fabiancancellara.ch/e_index.php">Fabian Cancellara</a>, <a href = "http://www.etixx-quickstep.com/en/team/8/tom-boonen">Tom Boonen</a>).  With nick-names like Spartacus, Hercules, Tornado Tom, and Breakaway-Killer it's no wonder these men have dominated the races.  Below, you can find a listing of each race in the classics calendar and some details of the race with images, video, and previous winners.</p>

        <p><a href = "http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/spring-classics-2016-guide/" style = "color:blue; background-color:transparent; text-decoration:underline">This site</a> was the example I was working against.  What makes the site good or bad?  I like simple and lots of white-space, so on my end it's great.  If you're looking to interact with the site and give feedback or play games, click feedback options, etc... it does not have much for you.  From the source code, there are a lot of html elements like div, span, style, class, header, p, etc... that I understood.  There are also what seems to be some bootstrap imports (class = navbar, id = mainScreenShader, id = fullscreenmodehoverdetector, class = global-header/bottom-navbar-wrap, etc..) which I've only used in practice on CodeAcademy/FreeCodeCamp/etc...  I wanted to add a video to my site (cycling is more fun to watch than to read!) and the video attribute wasn't enough as I did not have a file on my computer to link to.  I used the Youtube embed link which is also appearing on the sample site's source code <!--<iframe src =""> --> and it worked great!  I also noticed lots of JavaScript (script attributes and .push .get var etc...).  I like the site as a simple outline of topics, links/videos/images, some clickable elements, and then forum and advertisements below.  I'm curious to see if I could code something like this myself in the near future.
